    <strong>DATA RETENTION POLICY</strong><br />
    <br />
    <strong>Introduction</strong><br />
    This Data Retention Policy (the &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) sets out how Agenpo retains Records (defined below) necessary
    for its business operations, contractual obligations, legal, audit and regulatory compliance, and when we may
    destroy such Records, whilst promoting orderly and efficient data management. This ensures compliance with the data
    protection laws and the duty of confidentiality to which we are bound. We retain your information for as long as
    necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected. The period of data storage and retention is subject to
    legal, regulatory, administrative and<br />
    operational requirements.<br />
    <br />
    Records include Information, data, documents (contractual, personal), correspondence, policies, confidential
    information, etc. regardless of media; created, received, and maintained by Agenpo as evidence, and in compliance
    with regulatory requirements, legal obligations, business practices, legal policies, contractual obligations,
    financial transactions, administrative activities, business decisions or other actions. Records provide information
    about, and evidence of Agenpo&rsquo;s transactions, customers, employment and activities, and may be created,
    received or maintained in hard copy or<br />
    electronic format.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Scope of this Policy</strong><br />
    The main objective of this Policy is to ensure that complete and accurate Records are identified, retained, stored,
    protected and subsequently destroyed or archived appropriately under such terms and within such periods set out in
    this Policy. This Policy applies to our Platform, and all related sites, applications, services and tools regardless
    of how they are accessed or used. It also covers all Records stored on company-owned, leased, and otherwise
    company-provided systems and media, regardless of location, including our servers, third- party servers; computer
    systems (desktops or laptops), mobile devices, physical records stored at our offices or other locations.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Policy Administrator</strong><br />
    Agenpo&rsquo;s Data Compliance Officer (DCO) shall oversee the administration, implementation and the procedure of
    this Policy. The DCO works with the company&rsquo;s management and legal &amp;amp; compliance department and shall
    ensure that the data retention schedule (below) is followed. The DCO has the authority to review the data retention
    procedures; monitor compliance; make modifications to the data retention schedule when necessary to ensure it
    complies with the relevant laws, encompasses new developments and contains the appropriate records and
    document.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Security measures</strong><br />
    In addition to other existing data protection measures being implemented by Agenpo, we will ensure that the
    following measures are in place to protect the security of retained Records:<br />
    <br />
    a. All Records received and retained through emails must be encrypted and/or password protected and will only be
    transmitted and stored over secure networks.<br />
    b. All Records retained physically (in hardcopy form) will be stored in a secure container, file or folder, marked
    &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; and kept in a safe location.<br />
    c. Records whether physical or electronic will be stored in secure folders and will not be left unattended.<br />
    d. Computers used to retain Records will always be password protected, properly maintained, and protected from virus
    or unauthorized access.<br />
    e. Retained Records will not be stored in the personal devices of employees of the company.<br />
    f. All Records stored electronically will be backed up periodically with back-ups stored onsite at our offices or
    offsite at a data center.<br />
    g. All electronic copies of Records will be stored securely using passwords and encryption as appropriate.<br />
    h. Records will be retained in a secure location, with limited access to authorised personnel only.<br />
    i. All passwords used to protect Records will be changed periodically and will be secure.<br />
    j. All Records retained during their specified periods will be traceable and retrievable.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Retention Period and Procedures</strong><br />
    For all Records obtained, used and stored by Agenpo, we will conduct periodic reviews of the Records retained,
    confirming their purpose, continued validity, accuracy and requirement to retain such Records. Records will be kept
    for as long as they are needed to meet the operational or contractual needs of Agenpo, together with legal and
    regulatory requirements. Agenpo may transfer paper-based Records to an alternative media format in instances of long
    retention periods. As a general principle, Agenpo will only need to retain one copy of the final version of a
    Record. Draft documents may be destroyed immediately unless they contain vital information which were not otherwise
    contained the final ocument.<br />
    <br />
    The retention periods for Records provided under this Policy takes into consideration: the requirements of Agenpo
    for such Records; the type, sensitivity and importance of such Record; contractual obligations; the purpose of
    processing such record; lawful basis for processing the records; the requirements of the law. Where it is not
    possible to define a statutory or legal retention period in line with the applicable data protection/privacy laws,
    we will identify the criteria by which the period can be determined (such as industry standards) and update this
    Policy as may be necessary.<br />
    <br />
    Records must be categorised by purpose and retained for specific periods in accordance with the Retention Schedule
    below. Retained Records will be grouped by category and in a clear date order when the Record was stored and/or
    archived. Notwithstanding the retention periods provided in the retention schedule below, Records which are subject
    of, or required in any pending litigation, investigation or other regulatory process shall not be destroyed or
    altered, until the completion of such process.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Destruction of Records</strong><br />
    Destruction of Records is a critical component of our data retention policy. Once the retention period has elapsed,
    the Records are either reviewed, archived, returned, anonymized or confidentially destroyed depending on their
    purpose, importance and legal requirements. When a Record has reached its designated destruction date, the DCO shall
    refer to the retention register to determine the next action to be taken. Not all data or records are expected to be
    deleted upon<br />
    expiration; sometimes it is sufficient to anonymise the data, return the Record or to archive Records for a further
    period.<br />
    <br />
    Records will not be kept after the retention period unless:<br />
    <br />
    a. the Record is the subject of a pending litigation, administrative or regulatory proceedings. In these
    circumstances, destruction will be delayed until such regulatory proceedings have been completed, at which time a
    new retention period will be created.<br />
    b. the Record has long-term value for Agenpo&rsquo;s statutory or regulatory obligations.<br />
    c. Agenpo determines that such Record will be permanently stored, provided that no legal, regulatory or contractual
    breach will occur by the permanent retention of such record.<br />
    d. there is a legal or regulatory reason or order to maintain the Records either permanently or for a longer
    period.<br />
    <br />
    Agenpo is committed to the secure and safe disposal of any Record in accordance with our contractual and legal
    obligations. Accordingly, when the Records have been retained until the end of their retention period, they can be
    destroyed in the following ways:<br />
    <br />
    a. Hardcopy of documents will be destroyed by shredding or burning.<br />
    b. Non-sensitive information can be thrown in a normal trash bin and properly disposed.<br />
    c. Electronic Records will be deleted/erased and cleared from recycle bins, the cloud and other back-up systems it
    has been saved to.<br />
    d. Electronic equipment or systems containing Records will be destroyed. Where a specific Record is stored in one
    single media such as a CD Rom and cannot be erased, such media used to store the Record will be physically
    destroyed. However, where the media contains other Records which are not due for deletion, and it is impossible to
    separately erase such Record due for deletion, the retention period shall be extended to such period when all the
    Records in that<br />
    media are due for deletion/destruction, and Agenpo shall either format or physically destroy the media.<br />
    e. Destruction of electronic Records should render them non-recoverable even using forensic data recovery
    techniques.<br />
    <br />
